# kirbix's Voice Acting Directory

This is where I store all of my audio files I can make free for anyone to use for any purpose (as long as you credit me of course)

Almost every single audio file I upload will be licensed under:
- CC-BY 4.0, where you can do whatever you want with it as long as you credit me (if you don't, I will sue you hehehehe)

  ---OR---

- (If I'm generaous enough to do it) CC0, which is the Creative Commons equivilant of a public domain where you can do whatever you want and you don't have to credit me (I won't stop you)

Also, this is intended to be a storage directory, not a software development directory, so you cannot do any pull requests no matter what you do.
